# healthcare-hub
Healthcare Hub was my team project for the WiCHacks 2020 in Rochester, NY. We won the prize for Best Use of Google Cloud Software, presented by MLH.

## Concept Idea
The project concept was to have a website that offered free and accessible diagnoses to Americans through technology

## Purpose and Reason
The reason for this is because there is privatized healthcare in the US, which makes in inaccessible for many US citizens
due to the various socioeconomic circumstances.

## Solution and Result
I contributed to this project by training a machine learning model based on skin lesion images,
to identify user uploads based on 7 categories. This can be used by users to identify skin lesions on their bodies without
immediately having to pay for a consultation.
